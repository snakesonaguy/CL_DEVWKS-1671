# Cisco Live! DevNet Workshop 2225 (DEVWKS-2225)

Welcome to Cisco Live! In this DevNet workshop we will be covering how to automate the collection of inventory information utilizing Cisco Network Services Orchestator and Python3. While NSO is a key component in this lab many of these task can also be performed utilizing other Cisco technologies such as DNA Center. The main goals of this lab are to demonstrate how to:

1. make REST calls to controllers (NSO in this case).
2. parse and utilize the data you receive.
3. read API documentation (the NSO RESTConf API in this case).
4. turn your data into a useful product.

## Notes:

If you are taking this lab at CLUS 2022 you should be provided a workstation. This workstation has been configured with the correct Python packages, tools, and an IDE (vsCode) to perform the lab. If you are performing this lab on your own equipment please refer to the SETUP.md file.
